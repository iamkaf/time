# TIME App - Multi-Page Application Development

## Project Status: Enhanced MVP Complete â†’ Multi-Page Architecture

The core time tracking functionality is production-ready. Now expanding to a full multi-page application with sidebar navigation while **preserving ALL existing dashboard features**.

## ðŸš¨ TODAY'S PRIORITY: Vertical Slice Implementation

**GOAL: Ship a working vertical slice with ALL new pages navigable by END OF DAY.**

**Approach: Speed over perfection. Get all pages created and navigable first, polish later.**

### Vertical Slice Requirements (Bare Minimum Functionality)

**Routing Structure:**
- Root (/) is the landing page (stays as is)
- Dashboard is already at /dashboard (no changes needed)
- All authenticated pages under /dashboard/*
- Routes: /dashboard, /dashboard/sessions, /dashboard/changelog, /dashboard/settings

- [ ] **Sidebar Navigation**
  - [ ] Simple vertical sidebar with links
  - [ ] Active route highlighting
  - [ ] Mobile responsive (hamburger toggle)
  - [ ] Links: TIME, Sessions, Changelog, Settings

- [ ] **TIME Page** (Current Dashboard)
  - [ ] Dashboard already at /dashboard - no route changes needed
  - [ ] Just wrap with sidebar layout
  - [ ] No changes to dashboard functionality - already complete

- [ ] **Sessions Page** (/dashboard/sessions)
  - [ ] Basic page with title "Sessions"
  - [ ] Simple tab switcher (Sessions | Details | Export)
  - [ ] Sessions tab: List 10 most recent sessions (reuse existing component)
  - [ ] Details tab: Placeholder text "Analytics coming soon"
  - [ ] Export tab: Simple button "Download CSV" (can be non-functional)

- [ ] **Changelog Page** (/dashboard/changelog)
  - [ ] Static page with title "Changelog"
  - [ ] One hardcoded entry showing "v0.1.0 - Initial Release"
  - [ ] Basic styling with date and bullet points

- [ ] **Settings Page** (/dashboard/settings)
  - [ ] Page with title "Settings"
  - [ ] Replicate existing theme toggle here
  - [ ] Add placeholder sections for future settings

### Definition of DONE for Today:
1. âœ… User can navigate between all pages via sidebar
2. âœ… Each page loads without errors
3. âœ… Mobile responsive navigation works
4. âœ… No regressions to existing functionality
5. âœ… Deployed and accessible

**After this vertical slice is complete, we'll iterate on each page to add full functionality.**

### Timeline
- **Start**: NOW
- **End**: TODAY (End of Day)
- **Focus**: Working navigation between all pages
- **Non-goals**: Perfect styling, full functionality, complex features

### Implementation Order
1. Create sidebar component and new layout
2. Create placeholder pages (Sessions, Changelog, Settings)
3. Wire up navigation
4. Add mobile responsiveness
5. Test and ship
