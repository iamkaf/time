## Current Development: Enhanced Sessions Page

### Testing Required

**⚠️ HUMAN TASK: Test Enhanced Sessions Page**

I've implemented enhanced sessions functionality with:
- Full paginated session history (20 items per page, no limit)
- Search functionality by session name and tags
- Sorting by date, duration, and name (ascending/descending)
- Improved UI with sort indicators and result summaries

**Please test:**

1. **Navigate to `/dashboard/sessions`** 
   - Verify enhanced sessions list loads properly
   - Check pagination works (if you have 20+ sessions)

2. **Search functionality** 
   - Search by session names
   - Search by tag names  
   - Verify "No sessions found" message for non-matches

3. **Sorting functionality** 
   - Click Date/Duration/Name buttons
   - Verify sort direction indicators (arrows)
   - Check clicking same button reverses sort

4. **Pagination** (if applicable)
   - Use Previous/Next buttons
   - Verify page counter accuracy
   - Check search/sorting reset to page 1

5. **Existing functionality preserved**
   - Session editing via dropdown
   - Session deletion via dropdown
   - Real-time updates still work

**Report any issues found during testing.**
