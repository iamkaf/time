## ⚠️ JSON and PDF Export Formats - READY FOR TESTING

**HUMAN TASK: Test Multi-Format Export Functionality**

I've successfully implemented comprehensive export functionality with JSON and PDF support:

### Features Added:
- **Format Selection UI** - Radio button selector with descriptions for CSV, JSON, PDF
- **JSON Export** - Structured data with metadata, perfect for developers
- **PDF Export** - Professional table reports with TIME branding
- **Progressive Loading** - PDF library only loads when PDF format is selected (zero impact on other tabs)
- **Dynamic UI** - Download button and text update based on selected format

### Technical Implementation:
- ✅ Added jsPDF and jsPDF-autotable dependencies with Bun
- ✅ Created FormatSelector component with accessibility
- ✅ Extended useSessionExport hook with JSON/PDF generation functions
- ✅ Updated export controls UI with format selection
- ✅ All exports tracked in export history with format metadata
- ✅ Dynamic imports for PDF to avoid SSR issues
- ✅ Passed type check, lint, and build validation

### Please test:

1. **Navigate to Export Tab**
   - Go to `/dashboard/sessions` → Export tab
   - Verify format selector appears with 3 options (CSV, JSON, PDF)
   - CSV should be pre-selected with "Recommended" badge

2. **Test CSV Export** (should work as before)
   - Keep CSV selected
   - Configure date range and fields
   - Click "Download CSV" - should work identically to before
   - Verify file downloads and opens in spreadsheet apps

3. **Test JSON Export** (new)
   - Select JSON format
   - Notice download button changes to "Download JSON"
   - Click download - should generate JSON file
   - Open file - should see structured data with metadata header

4. **Test PDF Export** (new)
   - Select PDF format
   - Notice download button changes to "Download PDF"
   - Click download - should generate PDF report
   - Open file - should see professional table with TIME branding

5. **Test Progressive Loading**
   - Check network tab in browser dev tools
   - PDF libraries should only load when PDF format is selected
   - Sessions and Analytics tabs should have zero PDF overhead

6. **Test Export History**
   - Perform exports in different formats
   - Check browser console for export history tracking logs
   - Verify different formats are recorded correctly

**Report any export failures, UI issues, or performance problems.**

### Bundle Impact:
- Sessions tab: No impact (0KB PDF overhead)
- Export tab: Only ~1KB increase for format selector
- PDF generation: ~170KB loaded only when PDF selected
